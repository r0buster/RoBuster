More races / different input method

for virginity make checkmark system because (while rare) when some female turns into futa she might've already used that wondrous pole, you know?

for sliders, make direct input possible for rare instances where gradation by 50 isn't good enough

also I don't see ability levels for sensitivities and experience for c v a b m u

properly check if each trait has the correct jap tag

javascript notice only when not enabled
